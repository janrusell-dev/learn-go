# Learning Go from Go by Example

This repository contains my Go practice exercises as I learn Go from [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/).  
The purpose of this repository is to **master Go**, from basic syntax to advanced concepts like concurrency, error handling, networking, and testing.

## Running Tests
```bash
go test ./learn
```

To run tests with verbose output:
```bash
go test -v ./learn
```
